# cle
---
A key to your deep learning research.<br>
'cle' is not a building in which it costs a lot to live,<br>
but a playground which is open to everyone for free.

We try to manage minimum lines of implementation.<br>
Over-engineering is not beautiful.

If you happen to use this library, or use some of the implementations in this library,<br>
please don't forget to cite and give credits to the right libraries (do not remove references in the docstrings).

If you happen to use GF-RNN implementation, please do cite this paper:<br>
Junyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, Kyunghyun Cho and Yoshua Bengio, "Gated Feedback Recurrent Neural Networks", in <I>ICML</I>, 2015.
